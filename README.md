# Factris Assignment.

Hi there! This is the technical assignment from Factris.

The task is for you to create an app thats will list all the people in the data provided with their home planet.

For example when "Luke Skywalker" is called, the information should included information about Lukes home planet "Tatooine".

You should be able to filter people by their gender, spiecies and homeplanet. 

The UI is up to you. We don't expect a complete product here but we would like to see some key features for when working on the assignment.  We are interested in your approach to the problem.

We would like to see:
- ReactJS best practices
- Redux

Nice to have:
- unit testing

## Data

We have some sample data from https://swapi.co/ the data is included inside this repository in the "data" directory. This is done so avoid using the API directly to avoid any CORS issues and that would be outside the scope of this assignment.

If you have any question feel free to contact us.

Good luck.
